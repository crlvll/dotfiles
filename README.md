# Dotfiles

My configuration files for zsh, tmux, nvim and so forth.

# Notes

The intention is to be able to run a setup script after cloning the repo on any
unix-like machine and be up and running as quickly as possible.

# Linux

```bash
DOTFILES_DIR=$HOME/Repos/github.com/crlvll
mkdir -p $DOTFILES_DIR
cd $DOTFILES_DIR
git clone https://github.com/crlvll/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
```
